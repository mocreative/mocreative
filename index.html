    <h2 class="align-left">What I Do.</h2>
    <p>I help business owners to achieve their digital marketing goals – whether that's getting more followers, attracting more traffic or selling more online.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-4">
    <h3>E-Commerce Management</h3>
    <p>Sometimes managing your online buisiness takes more hours than there are in the day. With years of experiance with multiple backend systems, I can take care of everyhting from bulk product uploads, to product optimisation.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-4">
    <h3>Instagram Management</h3>
    <p>As a visual platform, Instagram is perfectly suited to brands that have a strong product focus. For instance, if you’re in the food, fashion, travel, art or design industry, and you’re looking to take your brand awareness a notch higher, it really is a no-brainer.
</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-4">
    <h3>Facebook Marketing</h3>
    <p>When it comes to building strong community engagement, Facebook can be the most powerful social media tool for brands. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-4">
    <h3>Blog &amp; Web Content</h3>
    <p> Writing professional copy for small business websites is a long term joy of mine. I write content that improves their visibility in search engines (via SEO), keeps visitors on the site longer (via clear, structured, well-written content) and converts more visitors into customers (via persuasive sales messages and strong calls to action).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-4">
    <h3>Twitter Marketing</h3>
    <p> For a brand, being able to spread their message and have a conversation with millions of potential customers – all with no cash required – is an offer too good to pass up.

    I show you how to harness the power of this dynamic platform, so it opens up opportunities to boost your brand awareness and acquire new customers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-4">
    <h3>Email Campaigns</h3>
    <p>I provide a full management service comprising of responsive newsletter design, HTML build, pre-sending checks, (ensuring the email will work cross-client and cross-browser) and detailed post-campaign analysis.</p>
