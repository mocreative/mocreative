          <p> Started by Carmine Soriano, the vision was to create a fashion forward salon whilst maintaining a warm and inviting feel. Carmine was looking to expand his salon and bring in new clients. Together we created a digital presence that instantly grew his brand perception and salon foot traffic.</p>

          <p> Pummel love fitness and want everyone to have the help of a top personal trainer or fitness expert. They believe that pre-recorded programmes are no replacement for real one on one training. Fitness advice should not only be professional and accurate, it needs to be personalised. So we created a mobile app to help find the best trainers and fitness professionals in clients area. To gain momentum for the launch, we created a digital prescence that encouraged people to get involved.</p>
