  <h3>E-COMMERCE MANAGEMENT</h3>
  <p>
    Sometimes managing your online buisiness takes more hours than there are in the day. With years of experiance with multiple backend systems, I can take care of everyhting from bulk product uploads, to product optimisation.
  </p>

  <h3>INSTAGRAM MARKETING</h3>
  <p>
    As a visual platform, Instagram is perfectly suited to brands that have a strong product focus. For instance, if you’re in the food, fashion, travel, art or design industry, and you’re looking to take your brand awareness a notch higher, it really is a no-brainer.

    The essence of my approach is based around bringing together the most relevant tiers of engagement marketing, so you can realise your business goals.
  </p>

  <h3>FACEBOOK MARKETING</h3>
  <p>
    When it comes to building strong community engagement, Facebook can be the most powerful social media tool for brands.

    When building a brand on Facebook I bring together a combination of proven techniques that are designed to skyrocket customer engagement.
  </p>

  <h3>BLOG &amp; WEB CONTENT</h3>
  <p>
    Writing professional copy for small business websites is a long term joy of mine. I write content that improves their visibility in search engines (via SEO), keeps visitors on the site longer (via clear, structured, well-written content) and converts more visitors into customers (via persuasive sales messages and strong calls to action).
  </p>

  <h3>TWITTER MARKETING</h3>
  <p>
    For a brand, being able to spread their message and have a conversation with millions of potential customers – all with no cash required – is an offer too good to pass up.

    I show you how to harness the power of this dynamic platform, so it opens up opportunities to boost your brand awareness and acquire new customers.
  </p>

  <h3>EMAIL CAMPAIGNS</h3>
  <p>
    I provide a full management service comprising of responsive newsletter design, HTML build, pre-sending checks, (ensuring the email will work cross-client and cross-browser) and detailed post-campaign analysis.
